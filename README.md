# Ecommerce_database


This is an ecommerce app that utilize database functionalities from Mysql to orginized and structure a database of products, categories and tags.

Each product is associated to a category with tags associated to products.  We utilized sequalized to stucture the code for the functionalities of this app.

Every route us configured to used all of the functionalities correctly in order to fetch relevant information.

The GET route is able to be used to access all of the information in our database.  The end user can also access individual items, categories or tags using the GET route.  Thet requested items are presented in a structured JSON format with association also being presented.

The POST routes function to add items to each individual table within the databases. 

The PUT routes funtion to update the information for individual items in the database. 

The DELETE routes also function to delete individual items from the database entirely.

Error catching and displaying is also utilised in the app so that the end user can understand when they are requesting information that is not within the database.
